## A little note about this website

It's not very nice looking, but that's okay. It was a project that @philhawksworth (Netlify team) dreamed up as a bit of an easter egg to support the launch of buying custom domains on Netlify. Then, @yourfrienderin begged him to teach her how to create a website in the process. You can make it better! Pull requests welcome <3
